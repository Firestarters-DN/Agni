#Agni
WHAT IS AGNI:

We are proposing essentially an interactive map of a predictive model of fire risk for points of interest within cities alongside the West Coast of America. This would be visualized through osmnx for Anaconda andf other mapping tools and the decision trees could be implemented through machine learning libraries such as T-GANS and sklearn. Datasets would include shapefiles from NASA's FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Managment) https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/#firms-shapefile and records of fire incidents. Predictive features could include local climate, type of landuse, radius from a fire station, etc.

Functionalities:
We will be incorporating insights such as estimates for loss from fire with tools such as Oasis Loss Modeling Framework 
We will also be attempting to notify authorities of points of interest and buildings that would be needing inspections 

We are taking a vision from previous ideas and models such as Will Wright's simualation "toys" such as Simcity and applications of predictive machine learning of fire modeling such as Alanta's Firebird project  

We are looking for people with experience with urban planning, resource managment and loss modeling
